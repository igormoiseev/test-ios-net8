 
 
 updating to MvvmCross 9.4.0 would definitely improve navigation! You're currently on 9.3.0, and version 9.4.0 (released July 17, 2024) introduced significant navigation improvements.
Key Navigation Improvement in 9.4.0
Version 9.4.0 added built-in result-based navigation with:
New IMvxResultViewModelManager interface
MvxResultAwaitingViewModel base class
MvxResultSettingViewModel base class
Enhanced methods in MvxNavigationService for awaiting results
This means instead of manually using TaskCompletionSource (like you're doing now), you could use the built-in result navigation pattern.
Current vs. 9.4.0 Approach
Current (9.3.0) - Manual pattern:

// What you're doing now
private readonly TaskCompletionSource<DetailResult> _resultSource = new();
public Task<DetailResult> ResultTask => _resultSource.Task;
With 9.4.0 - Built-in support:

// Cleaner with built-in base classes
public class DetailViewModel : MvxResultSettingViewModel<DetailParameter, DetailResult>
Other Benefits in 9.4.0
iOS SceneDelegate support
Various bug fixes and stability improvements
Better thread pool handling for TaskCompletionSource continuations
Should You Update?
Yes, I recommend updating from 9.3.0 to 9.4.0 because:
You'll get official support for the result-based navigation you're trying to implement
Cleaner, more maintainable code using framework base classes
Bug fixes and stability improvements
Would you like me to update your project to MvvmCross 9.4.0 and refactor the navigation code to use the new built-in result navigation? Sources:

*****************

Done! I've updated your navigation to use the new MvvCross 9.4 features. Here's what changed:
DetailViewModel.cs
Now extends MvxResultSettingViewModel<DetailParameter, DetailResult> instead of manually managing TaskCompletionSource
Uses PrepareFromParameters() override to receive parameters
Uses SetResultAndClose() method (built into MvvCross 9.4) instead of manually calling _resultSource.TrySetResult() and _navigationService.Close()
FirstViewModel.cs
Uses NavigateFor<TViewModel, TParameter, TResult>() method which automatically awaits the result
Directly receives the result without needing to access a ResultTask property
Handles the result immediately after navigation completes
Key Benefits
The new MvvCross 9.4 navigation pattern provides:
Cleaner code: No manual TaskCompletionSource management
Type safety: The framework handles result passing automatically
Built-in support: Framework-provided base classes and methods
Easier to maintain: Less boilerplate code
The navigation now works seamlessly - when you tap the button in FirstViewModel, it navigates to DetailViewModel, and when you save or cancel, the result automatically flows back to FirstViewModel where you can immediately handle it!
